  title: Open Sourcing Your Life
  description: >
    <p>Developers often talk about optimising their code bases, but what about optimising our personal development?</p>
    <p>This session is about my journey with open sourcing my life.</p>
    <p>In October 2014, I put my personal goals on GitHub (things I want to learn and do), set up a weekly review system, and even created some terminal aliases to make it even easier. I've since had several external contributions to this repo and it is one of my most popular. The system has grown over time.</p>
    <p>Living out loud has made me MUCH more productive and has allowed me to honestly reach these goals. This session will cover my experience and teach you how to set up your own personal goals system.</p>

  title: Performance on RAILs
  description: >
    <p>Looking around at web performance advice today can be overwhelming: everything comes with caveats, disclaimers, and sometimes one piece of advice can seem to actively contradict another. Phrases like “the DOM is slow” or “always use CSS animations!” make for great headlines, but the truth is often far more nuanced. In this session we'll look at how to think holistically about performance, and how to prioritize optimization work that your users will notice and appreciate.</p>

  title: Done Is Better Than Perfect
  description: >
    <p>The Heroku dashboard is a large client side JavaScript app which was rewritten with Ember last year. Since then the project has gone from a promising greenfield of perfect code to a bit of a mess and lately, back again.</p>
    <p>This is a story about the practicalities of working on a large software project. Trying to do the right thing, making trade offs along the way and taking tough decisions to get the thing shipped. We'll talk about balancing conflicting requirements, when to compromise, when not to and how to clean up afterwards.</p>
